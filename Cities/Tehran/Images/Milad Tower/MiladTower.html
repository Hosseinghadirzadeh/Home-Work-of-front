    <H1>Milad Tower</H1>
    <p>Milad Tower is 435 meters (1,427 ft) tall and is the tallest tower in Iran, and the sixth-tallest telecommunication
    tower in the world. It consists of five main parts, including the foundation, transition (lobby) structure, shaft, head
    structure and the antenna mast.
    
    The lobby structure consists of six floors. The first three floors consist of 63 trade units, 11 food courts, a
    cafeteria, and a commercial products exhibition which is supposed to be about 260 square metres (2,800 sq ft).[3] The
    first and second underground floors consist of installing sections and a data center. The ground floor is dedicated to
    the entrance and the gatehouse.

    The shaft is a concrete structure about 315 metres (1,033 ft) high from the ground floor. Six elevators in three
    different sides of the shaft are used to transfer the visitors to the head of the tower at the speed of 7 metres per
    second (0.0070 km/s), besides an emergency staircase at the fourth side.
    
    The head of the tower is a steel structure weighing about 25,000 tonnes and consisting of 12 floors. The top floors of
    the tower include a public art gallery, a cafeteria, a revolving restaurant, a VIP restaurant, telecommunication floors,
    mechanical floors, fire-immune areas built as a refuge zone,[8] a closed observation deck, an open observation deck, and
    a sky dome.[2]
    
    The four-stage antenna mast is about 120 metres (390 ft) high. The lower floor of the mast is for the adjustment of
    public users' telecommunication antennas, and the three upper floors are dedicated to the antenna of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran Broadcasting.[2][3]
    
    The complex also features a parking area of about 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft), a large computer and
    telecommunications unit, a cultural and scientific unit, a commercial transaction center, a temporary showroom for
    exhibiting products, a specialized library, an exhibition hall, and an administrative unit.
    
    The Milad Tower has an octagonal base, symbolizing traditional Iranian architecture.[2]</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Milad Tower was part of the Shahestan Pahlavi project, a vast development for a new government and commercial centre
    for Tehran, that was designed in the 1970s but never materialized, except for the Tower. After an international
    competition, the project was awarded to the Llewely Davies Company, and construction was inaugurated on August 19, 1975,
    with the Shah of Iran and the Mayor of Tehran Dr G.R. Nickpay burying a commemorative gold plaque .[7] There is also
    another background of building this tower, since the construction of the tower was started after the 1979 revolution.
    The new government of Iran wanted to create a new symbol for Tehran to replace the Azadi Tower that was a symbol of
    Pahlavi's reign.</p>
