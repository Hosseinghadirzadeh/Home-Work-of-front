    <h2> Tehran</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Tehran (/tɛəˈræn, -ˈrɑːn, ˌteɪə-/; Persian: تهران Tehrān [tehˈɾɒːn] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital of
        Iran and
        Tehran Province. With a population of around 8.7 million in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan
        area of
        Greater Tehran, Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia,[6] and has the second-largest
        metropolitan
        area in the Middle East, after Cairo). It is ranked 24th in the world by metropolitan area population. It is
        also known
        for its sprawling development and futuristic architecture, epitomized by the Milad Tower and the Fereshteh
        Pasargad
        Hotel, designed by Zaha Hadid.[7]

        In the Classical era, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages, a prominent Median
        city[8]
        destroyed in the medieval Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions. Modern Ray is urban area absorbed into the
        metropolitan
        area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tehran">Greater Tehran</a> .

        Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786, because of
        its
        proximity to Iran's territories in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the Russo-Iranian Wars, to avoid
        the vying
        factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times throughout
        history, and
        Tehran is the 32nd national capital of Persia. Large-scale demolition and rebuilding began in the 1920s, and
        Tehran has
        been a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.[9]

        Tehran is home to many historical locations, including the royal complexes of Golestan, Sa'dabad, and Niavaran,
        where
        the two last dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated. Tehran's most famous landmarks include
        the
        Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the
        2,500th
        anniversary of the founding of the Imperial State of Iran, and the Milad Tower, the world's sixth-tallest
        self-supporting tower, originally planned by the Shah, completed in 2007, and the Tabiat Bridge, completed in
        2014.[10]

        Most of the population are Persian,[11][12] and roughly 99% of them understand and speak the Persian language,
        but large
        populations of other ethno-linguistic groups live in Tehran and speak Persian as a second language.[13]

        Tehran has an international airport (Imam Khomeini Airport), a domestic airport (Mehrabad Airport), a central
        railway
        station, a rapid transit system, Tehran Metro, a bus rapid transit system, trolleybuses, and a large network of
        highways.

        Plans to relocate Iran's capital from Tehran to another area, due to air pollution and earthquakes, have so far
        not yet
        received approval. A 2016 survey of 230 cities by consultant Mercer ranked Tehran 203rd for quality of life.[14]
        According to the Global Destinations Cities Index in 2016, Tehran is among the top ten fastest growing
        destinations.[15]

        The City Council declared October 6 Tehran Day in 2016, celebrating the day in 1907 when the city officially
        became the
        capital of Iran.[16]</p>

    <h3 id="Etymology">Etymology</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Various theories on the origin of the name Tehran have been put forward.

        Iranian linguist Ahmad Kasravi, in an article "Shemiran-Tehran", suggested that Tehran and Kehran mean "the warm
        place",
        and "Shemiran" means "the cool place". He listed cities with the same base and suffix and studied the components
        of the
        word in ancient Iranian languages, and came to the conclusion that Tehran and Kehran meant the same thing in
        different
        Iranian language families, as the constant "t" and "k" are close to each other in such languages. He also
        provided
        evidence that cities named "Shemiran" were cold, and those named "Tehran" or "Kehran" very hot. He considered
        other
        theories not considering ancient history of Iranian languages such as "Tirgan" theory and "Tahran" theory folk
        etymology.[17]

        Another theory is that "Tehran" derives from Tiran/Tirgan, "the abode of Tir", the Zoroastrian equivalent of
        Hermes).
        The ancient Parthian town of Tiran had a neighbour, Mehran ("abode of Mehr/Mithra", the Zoroastrian sun god).
        Both of
        these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran still exists as a residential
        district
        in Greater Tehran, as well as Ray, which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.

        The official City of Tehran website says that "Tehran" comes from the Persian words "Tah" meaning "end or
        bottom" and
        "Ran" meaning "[mountain] slope"—literally, the bottom of the mountain. Given Tehran's position at the foot of
        the
        Alborz mountains, this seems plausible. (دامنه ی بین دو کوه).[18]</p>
    <br><br><br>

    <h3 id="history">History</h3>
    <hr>
    <span>Archaeological remains from the ancient city of Ray suggest that settlement in Tehran dates back over 8,000
        years.[19]</span><br><br>

    <strong id="ClassicalEra">Classical era</strong>
    <p>Tehran is in the historical Media region of (Old Persian: 𐎶𐎠𐎭 Māda) in northwestern Iran. By the time of the
        Median
        Empire, part of present-day Tehran was a suburb of the prominent Median city of Rhages (Old Persian: 𐎼𐎥𐎠
        Ragā). In
        the Avesta's Videvdat (i, 15), Rhages is mentioned as the 12th sacred place created by Ohrmazd.[20] In Old
        Persian
        inscriptions, Rhages appears as a province (Bistun 2, 10–18). From Rhages, Darius I sent reinforcements to his
        father
        Hystaspes, who was putting down a rebellion in Parthia (Bistun 3, 1–10).[20] Some Middle Persian texts give
        Rhages as
        the birthplace of Zoroaster,[21] although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoroaster in Khorasan
        Province.

        Mount Damavand, the highest peak of Iran, which is located near Tehran, is an important location in Ferdowsi's
        Šāhnāme,[22] an Iranian epic poem based on the ancient legends of Iran. It appears in the epics as the homeland
        of the
        protoplast Keyumars, the birthplace of King Manuchehr, the place where King Fereydun bound the dragon fiend
        Aždahāk
        (Bivarasp), and the place where Arash shot his arrow.[22]</p>
    <br><br>
    <strong id="MedievalEra">Medieval Era</strong>
    <p>In 641, during the reign of the Sasanian Empire, Yazdgerd III issued his last appeal to the nation from Rhages,
        before
        fleeing to Khorasan.[20] Rhages was dominated by the Parthian House of Mihran, and Siyavakhsh—the son of Mehran,
        the son
        of Bahram Chobin—who resisted the 7th-century Muslim invasion of Iran.[20] Because of this resistance, when the
        Arabs
        captured Rhages, they ordered the town destroyed and rebuilt anew by traitor aristocrat Farrukhzad.[20]

        In the 9th century, Tehran was a well-known village, but less so than the city of Rhages, flourishing nearby.
        Rhages was
        described in detail by 10th-century Muslim geographers.[20] Despite the interest that Arabian Baghdad displayed
        in
        Rhages, the number of Arabs in the city remained insignificant and the population mainly consisted of Iranians
        of all
        classes.[20][23]

        The Oghuz Turks invaded Rhages in 1035 and again in 1042, but the city was recovered under the Seljuks and the
        Khwarezmians.[20] Medieval writer Najm od Din Razi declared the population of Rhages about 500,000 before the
        Mongol
        invasion. In the 13th century, the Mongols invaded Rhages, laid the city to ruins, and massacred many of its
        inhabitants.[20] Others escaped to Tehran.

        In July 1404, Castilian ambassador Ruy González de Clavijo visited Tehran on a journey to Samarkand, the capital
        of
        Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur, the ruler of Iran at the time. He described it in his diary as an unwalled region.
    </p><br>
    <strong id="Early">Early modern era</strong>

    <p>In the early 18th century, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ordered a palace and a government office built in
        Tehran,
        possibly to declare the city his capital; but he later moved his government to Shiraz. Eventually, Qajar king
        Agha
        Mohammad Khan chose Tehran as the capital of Iran in 1786.[25]

        Agha Mohammad Khan's choice of his capital was based on a similar concern for the control of both northern and
        southern
        Iran.[25] He was aware of the loyalties of the inhabitants of former capitals Isfahan and Shiraz to the Safavid
        and Zand
        dynasties respectively, and was wary of the power of the local notables in these cities.[25] Thus, he probably
        viewed
        Tehran's lack of a substantial urban structure as a blessing, because it minimized the chances of resistance to
        his rule
        by the notables and by the general public.[25] Moreover, he had to remain within close reach of Azerbaijan and
        Iran's
        integral northern and southern Caucasian territories[25]—at that time not yet irrevocably lost per the treaties
        of
        Golestan and Turkmenchay to the neighboring Russian Empire—which would follow in the course of the 19th
        century.[26]


        Map of Tehran in 1857
        After 50 years of Qajar rule, the city still barely had more than 80,000 inhabitants.[25] Up until the 1870s,
        Tehran
        consisted of a walled citadel, a roofed bazaar, and the three main neighborhoods of Udlajan, Chale-Meydan, and
        Sangelaj,
        where the majority resided.

        The first development plan of Tehran in 1855 emphasized traditional spatial structure. The second, under the
        supervision
        of Dar ol Fonun in 1878, included new city walls, in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of 19 square
        kilometers,
        mimicking the Renaissance cities of Europe.[27] Tehran was 19.79 square kilometers, and had expanded more than
        fourfold.

        The metropolis of Tehran is divided into 22 municipal districts, each with its own administrative center. Of the
        22
        municipal districts, 20 are located in Tehran County's Central District, while districts 1 and 20 are
        respectively
        located in the counties of Shemiranat and Ray. Although administratively separate, the cities of Ray and
        Shemiran are
        often considered part of Greater Tehran.

    <p>Northern Tehran is the wealthiest part of the city,[31] consisting of various districts such as Zaferanie,
        Jordan,
        Elahie, Pasdaran, Kamranie, Ajodanie, Farmanie, Darrous, Qeytarie, and Qarb Town.[32][33] While the center of
        the city
        houses government ministries and headquarters, commercial centers are more located further north.</p>
    <strong id="cli">Climate</strong>
    <p>Tehran has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSk) with continental climate characteristics
        and a
        Mediterranean climate precipitation pattern. Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location,
        with the
        towering Alborz mountains to its north and the country's central desert to the south. It can be generally
        described as
        mild in spring and autumn, hot and dry in summer, and cold and wet in winter.As the city has a large area, with
        significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is often
        cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran. For instance, the 17.3 km (10.7 mi) Valiasr
        Street
        runs from Tehran's railway station at 1,117 m (3,665 ft) elevation above sea level in the south of the city to
        Tajrish
        Square at 1712.6 m (5612.3 ft) elevation above sea level in the north.[34] However, the elevation can even rise
        up to
        2,000 m (6,600 ft) at the end of Velenjak in northern Tehran.

        Summer is long, hot, and dry with little rain, but relative humidity is generally low, making the heat
        tolerable.
        Average high temperatures are between 32 and 37 °C (90 and 99 °F), and it can occasionally drop to 14 °C (57 °F)
        in the
        mountainous north of the city at night. Most of the light annual precipitation occurs from late autumn to
        mid-spring,
        but no one month is particularly wet. The hottest month is July, with a mean minimum temperature of 26 °C (79
        °F) and a
        mean maximum temperature of 34 °C (93 °F), and the coldest is January, with a mean minimum temperature of −5 °C
        (23 °F)
        and a mean maximum temperature of 1 °C (34 °F).[35]

        The weather of Tehran can sometimes be unpredictably harsh. The record high temperature is 43 °C (109 °F) and
        the record
        low is −20 °C (−4 °F). On January 5 and 6, 2008, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures covered the city in a
        thick
        layer of snow and ice, forcing the Council of Ministers to officially declare a state of emergency and close
        down the
        capital from January 6 through January 7.[36]

        Tehran has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation since the beginning of the 21st
        century. These
        are most likely afforestation projects, which include expanding parks and lakes. The northern parts of Tehran
        are,
        still, lusher than the southern parts.</p><br><br><br>
    <h3 id="Demographics">Demographics</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The city of Tehran has a population of approximately 10 million in 2016.[47] With its cosmopolitan atmosphere,
        Tehran is
        home to diverse ethnic and linguistic groups from all over the country. The present-day dominant language of
        Tehran is
        the Tehrani variety of the Persian language, and the majority of people in Tehran identify themselves as
        Persians.[12][11] However, before, the native language of the Tehran–Ray region was not Persian, which is
        linguistically
        Southwest Iranian and originates in Fars, but a now extinct Northwestern Iranian language.[48]

        Iranian Azeris form the second-largest ethnic group of the city, comprising about 1/4[49][50] of the total
        population,
        while ethnic Mazanderanis are the third-largest, comprising about 17% of the total population.[51] Tehran's
        other ethnic
        communities include Kurds, Armenians, Georgians, Bakhtyaris, Talysh, Baloch, Assyrians, Arabs, Jews, and
        Circassians.

        According to a 2010 census conducted by the Sociology Department of the University of Tehran, in many districts
        of
        Tehran across various socio-economic classes in proportion to population sizes of each district and
        socio-economic
        class, 63% of the people were born in Tehran, 98% knew Persian, 75% identified themselves as ethnic Persian, and
        13% had
        some degree of proficiency in a European language.[11]

        Tehran saw a drastic change in its ethnic-social composition in the early 1980s. After the political, social,
        and
        economic consequences of the 1979 Revolution and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly
        Tehranis,
        left Iran. The majority of Iranian emigrations have left for the United States, Germany, Sweden, and Canada.

        With the start of the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during
        the
        Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave
        yet more
        reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and have struggled to
        adapt to
        a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also
        received
        a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering Iraq.

        The unstable situation and the war in neighbouring Afghanistan and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the
        country who
        arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to
        recover
        from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being
        repatriated
        with the assistance of the UNHCR, but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who
        are
        reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries. Afghan refugees are mostly
        Dari-speaking Tajik and Hazara, speaking a variety of Persian, and Iraqi refugees are mainly Mesopotamian
        Arabic-speakers who are often of Iranian heritage.</p>
    <strong id="reli">Religion</strong>
    <p>
        The majority of Tehranis are officially Twelver Shia Muslims, which has also been the state religion since the
        16th-century Safavid conversion. Other religious communities in the city include followers of the Sunni and
        Mystic
        branches of Islam, various Christian denominations, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Baháʼí Faith.

        There are many religious centres scattered around the city, from old to newly built centres, including mosques,
        churches, synagogues, and Zoroastrian fire temples. The city also has a very small third-generation Indian Sikh
        community with a local gurdwara that was visited by the Indian Prime Minister in 2012.[52]
