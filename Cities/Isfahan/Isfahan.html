    <h1>Isfahan</h1>
    <p>sfahan (Persian: اصفهان, romanized: Esfahān [esfæˈhɒːn] (About this soundlisten)), from its ancient designation Aspadana
    and later Spahan in middle Persian, rendered in English as Ispahan, is a major city in Greater Isfahan Region, Isfahan
    Province, Iran. It is located 406 kilometres (252 miles) south of Tehran and it is the capital of Isfahan Province.
    Isfahan has a population of approximately 1.9 million,[5] making it the third-largest city in Iran, after Mashhad and
    Tehran, and the second-largest metropolitan area.[6]
    
    It is located at the intersection of the two principal north-south and east-west routes that traverse Iran. Isfahan
    flourished between the 9th and 18th centuries under the Safavid dynasty, when it became the capital of Persia for the
    second time in its history under Shah Abbas the Great. The city retains much of its history. It is famous for its
    Perso–Islamic architecture, grand boulevards, covered bridges, palaces, tiled mosques, and minarets. Isfahan also has
    many historical buildings, monuments, paintings, and artifacts. The fame of Isfahan led to the Persian proverb "Esfahān
    nesf-e-jahān ast": Isfahan is half (of) the world.[7] The Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan is one of the largest city
    squares in the world. UNESCO has designated it a World Heritage Site.[8]</p>

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
<hr>
<p>Isfahan is derived from Middle Persian Spahān. Spahān is attested in various Middle Persian seals and inscriptions,
including that of the Zoroastrian magi Kartir,[9] and is also the Armenian name of the city (Սպահան). The present-day
name is the Arabicized form of Ispahan (unlike Middle Persian but similar to Spanish, New Persian does not allow initial
consonant clusters such as sp[10]). The region appears with the abbreviation GD (Southern Media) on Sasanian
numismatics. In Ptolemy's Geographia, it appears as Aspadana (Ἀσπαδανα), translating to "place of gathering for the
army". It is believed that Spahān derives from spādānām "the armies", Old Persian plural of spāda, from which derives
spāh (𐭮𐭯𐭠𐭧) 'army' and spahi (سپاهی, 'soldier', literally 'of the army') in Middle Persian. Some of the other
ancient names include Gey, Jey (old form Zi),[11] Park, and Judea.[12][13]</p>
