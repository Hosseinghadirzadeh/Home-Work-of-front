    <h1>Karaj</h1>

<p>Karaj (Persian: کرج, pronounced [kæˈɾædʒ] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital of Alborz Province, Iran, and
effectively a satellite city of Tehran. Although the county hosts a population around 1.97 million, as recorded in the
2016 census, most of the 1,419 km2 (548 sq mi) county is rugged mountain, the urban area is the fourth-largest in Iran,
after Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan.[3] Eshtehard County and Fardis County were split off from Karaj county since the
previous census.

The earliest records of Karaj date back to 30th century BC. The city was developed under the rule of the Safavid and
Qajar dynasties, and is home to historical buildings and memorials from those eras. Until the second half of the 20th
century, it used to be known mainly as a summer resort. Today, it is a major industrial city, with factories producing
sugar, textiles and wire.This city has an extraordinary climate due to access to natural resources such as many trees
and various rivers and green plains.</p>

<p>araj has been hosting communities since 3000 years BC.[4][5] The Khurvin region of Karaj has been inhabited since the
Bronze Age, and the Kelak region on the left bank of Karaj River since the Iron Age.

The stone built Takht-e Rostam, located on a mount in the west of Shahriar County, was built in the Parthian era as a
Zoroastrian fire temple.

Until the late 20th century, the city was mainly crossed into by a stone bridge built in the Safavid era. The stone
built Shah-Abbasi Caravansary, located at the southeast of Towhid Square, was built in the same era, under the rule of
Šāh Esmāil.[5]


Morvarid Palace in Karaj
In the 1810s, the Palace of Soleymaniye, which included four towers surrounded by gardens and walls, was built as a
summer resort by the order of Shahzaden Soleyman (Soleyman Mirza), an old prince governor of Kermānšāh.[5] Granted in
the Pahlavi era by Rezā Šāh Pahlavi, it is now housing the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Tehran.

The Morvārid Palace was constructed in nearby Mehršahr district, during the Pahlavi era. It was designed by the Frank
Lloyd Wright Foundation (Taliesin Associated Architects) on instructions from Shams Pahlavi, elder sister of Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi. Majority of the structure is now controlled by the Basij Organization, and some sections of it are open to
public under the operation of Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran.

Other historical sites of the city include the Mausoleum of Šāhzāde Soleymān, Emāmzāde Rahmān, Emāmzāde Zeyd, and Palang
Ābād e Eštehārd.[6]</p>
