    <h1>Fatima Masumeh Shrine</h1>
    <P>The Shrine of Fatima Masumeh (Persian: حرم فاطمه معصومه translit. haram-e fateme-ye masumeh) is located in Qom, which is
    considered by Shia Muslims to be the second most sacred city in Iran after Mashhad.
    
    Fatima Masumeh was the sister of the eighth Imam Reza and the daughter of the seventh Imam Musa al-Kadhim (Tabari 60).
    In Shia Islam, women are often revered as saints if they are close relatives to one of the Twelver Imams. Fatima Masumeh
    is therefore honored as a saint, and her shrine in Qom is considered one of the most significant Shi'i shrines in Iran.
    Every year, thousands of Shi'i Muslims travel to Qom to honor Fatima Masumeh and ask her for blessings.
    
    Also buried within the shrine are three daughters of the ninth Twelver Shī‘ah Imām Muhammad al-Taqī.[1]</P>
